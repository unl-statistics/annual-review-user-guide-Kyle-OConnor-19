Identify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?

I will be going through ways of how to prevent sensitive questions on surveys and polls from negatively affecting the Response Rate. The Review Article talks about 5 key ways to do this:

- Self-Administration of Survey/Poll (Non-Interview Methods)
- Ensuring Privacy, Confidentiality, and Anonymity (Eliminating the Bystander Effect and Respondent Identifiers)
- Asking Indirect versus Direct Questions (Randomized Response, Item Count Techniques)
- Respondent Psychological Manipulation (Bogus Pipeline Technique)
- Priming (Supplemental Material before Questions and Question Phrasing)
