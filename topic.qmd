# Topic

Pick some subset of the information covered in your annual review article that you are interested in exploring in more detail. 

Identify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will be going through ways of how to prevent sensitive questions on surveys and polls from negatively affecting the Response Rate. The Review Article talks about 5 key ways to do this:

- Self-Administration of Survey/Poll (Non-Interview Methods)
- Ensuring Privacy, Confidentiality, and Anonymity (Eliminating the Bystander Effect and Respondent Identifiers)
- Asking Indirect versus Direct Questions (Randomized Response, Item Count Techniques)
- Respondent Psychological Manipulation (Bogus Pipeline Technique)
- Priming (Supplemental Material before Questions and Question Phrasing)

# Comments/suggestions

Make sure you also provide good examples of what sensitive questions are and how certain techniques are and are not appropriate for certain types of sensitive questions. If you can find real-world data for e.g. sensitive vs. not sensitive questions covering the same topic, it may be helpful to use that to demonstrate.
